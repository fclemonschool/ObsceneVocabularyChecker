<h2>Wrapping errors</h2>

  <p>Mr. Krabs bought a used self-serve ice cream machine for the Krusty Krab that serves ice cream through a Go program... After just one day of use, the ice cream machine broke down, just like in every other fast food restaurant!</p> 
  <p>As usual, Mr. Krabs doesn't want to spend any money on a "broken ice cream machine" sign. Please help him implement a wrapped Go error message in the <code class="java">brokenMessage</code> function with the following contents:<em> "error: can't serve you an ice cream main cause of error: ice cream machine is broken"</em>.</p> 
  <p>The error message will automatically show up when customers try to use the machine and input the flavor of the ice cream they want.</p>
