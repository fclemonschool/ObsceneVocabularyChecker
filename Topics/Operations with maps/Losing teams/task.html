  <p>Following the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/standings/_/league/uefa.champions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">⚽️🏆 2021-2022 UEFA Champions League standings 🏆⚽️</a>, the Group H has been practically defined and the two teams that will pass to the knockout stage are Chelsea and Juventus.</p> 
  <p>Below you will see the predefined <code class="java">groupH</code> map that contains the team names as keys and the number of scored points as values.</p> 
  <p>Can you please implement the required code to delete the losing teams Zenit and Malmo from the <code class="java">groupH</code> map and also implement the <code class="java">for...range</code> loop to print the name of the two other teams that will pass to the knockout stage?</p>
