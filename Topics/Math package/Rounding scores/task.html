<h2>Rounding scores</h2>

  <p>Suppose you are a teacher at a primary school and need to grade your students' exams on a scale of integer values from <code class="java">0</code> to <code class="java">10</code>.</p> 
  <p>Since the final grade can only be an integer value, you need to create a Go program that calculates the final grade by rounding it either up or down, depending on the number of decimals of the calculated score; for example:</p> 
  <p>If the exam has 25 questions, and a student has 19 correct answers, their grade will be calculated with the following formula: <code class="java">19 / 25 * 10 = 7.6</code>. Afterwards, you should use the appropriate rounding function from the <code class="java">math</code> package to round the grade up, if the decimals are greater than <code class="java">&gt;= 0.5</code>, or down, if the decimals are less than <code class="java">&lt; 0.5</code>. Finally, print the final grade.</p>
