  <p>Daniel had a Go program that took as input the first name of a person, then the last name, and finally printed it to terminal:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-go">James // firstName
Bond  // lastName</code></pre> 
  <p>He wanted to change his program, for the output to be just like James Bond's famous introduction: <em>"Bond, James Bond":</em></p> 
  <pre><code class="language-go">Bond,
James Bond</code></pre> 
  <p>Daniel tried to change his Go program to achieve this type of output by implementing <code class="language-go">defer</code> statements. However, he's made some mistakes. To fix the program and get the proper output, you need to delete some <code class="language-go">defer</code> statements and also add a new one!</p>
