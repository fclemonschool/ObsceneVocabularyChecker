<h2>Converting boolean values to strings</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Patrick has created a small Go program to test out his knowledge on parsing data from strings. His program takes as input a <code class="java">bool</code> type value, then converts it to a string, and finally, prints both the converted type and its value.</p> 
  <p>When he tried to execute the program, he got an error because he used an incorrect function from the <code class="java">strconv</code> package.</p> 
  <p>Please help Patrick fix his code by implementing the correct function that allows you to convert a <code class="java">bool</code> type value to a string value, and then print both the converted type and its value.</p>
