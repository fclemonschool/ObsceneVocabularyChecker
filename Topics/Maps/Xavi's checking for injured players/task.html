  <p>Following <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Xavi HernÃ¡ndez's</a> management, in ğŸ”µğŸ”´ ğŸ”µ<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">F.C. Barcelona</a> ğŸ”µğŸ”´ ğŸ”µ there are some injured players that can't participate in any football matches.</p> 
  <p>The injured players are listed on the predefined <code class="language-go">injuredPlayers</code> map, the key is a <code class="language-go">string</code> with the name of the player and the value is an <code class="language-go">int</code> with the expected recovery time in days.</p> 
  <p>Can you help Xavi implement a program that takes the player name as an input, checks if the player is on the <code class="language-go">injuredPlayers</code> map, and prints a message with the player's name and the expected recovery time? In case the player is not on the map, the program should print a message explaining that the player isn't injured.</p> 
  <p>Below you can see an example of the expected output:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-go">// Output in case the player is injured (player is in the 'injuredPlayers' map):
The player Aguero will recover in 93 days

// Output in case the player is not injured (player is not in the 'injuredPlayers' map):
The player Memphis is not injured</code></pre>
