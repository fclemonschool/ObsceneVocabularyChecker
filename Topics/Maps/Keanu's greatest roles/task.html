 <body>
  <p>Keanu has just finished learning about maps and tried to create via map literals a map called <code class="java">keanuRoles</code>. The map would contain the name of the movies he had a role in as the keys and the names of the characters he played as the values. However, he's made some errors in his map declaration and his program won't compile.</p> 
  <p>Can you help Keanu fix the errors in his map declaration syntax?</p>
