  <p>Suppose you want to create a Go program that takes as the first input a certain delimiter and then a string. Afterwards, the program should output the string, including the delimiter.</p> 
  <p>To do this, you'll need to use a <code class="java">Reader</code>; we've already created it and written part of the code for you. Your task is to use the correct <code class="java">Reader</code> functions that take as an argument a delimiter and then output the string.</p>
