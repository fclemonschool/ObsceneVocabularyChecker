  <p>Plankton the evil genius is plotting a new evil plan with the help of Go programming! He has created a new package called <code class="java">weapons</code> in his Go project and wants to access the function <code class="java">DestroySpongeBob()</code> within it.</p> 
  <p>Can you help Plankton write the proper syntax required to access the function <code class="java">DestroySpongeBob()</code> from the <code class="java">weapons</code> package?</p>
